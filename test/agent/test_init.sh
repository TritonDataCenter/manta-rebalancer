#
# This is a utility intended to automate an appreciable amount of the laborious
# work required to set up a test enviornment to test the rebalancer agent.  It
# requires two arguments to get started:
#
# 1. The destination storage node on which object will reside in the form of
#    n.stor.<domain>.  An example would look like: 2.stor.us-west.joyent.us.
#
# 2. A path which contains one or more files that the rebalaner agent will
#    attempt to download during a test.
#
# With the provided storage node information and a file path, this utility will
# create an assignment based on this information and store it in a database
# which the rebalancer agent will be able to load from disk and process like an
# assignment that it would receive from a rebalancer zone.  In addition to
# creating the assignment, it will also upload the objects to the destination
# storage node (i.e. #1 above), where they will be stored in /manta/rebalancer.
# The upload is performed via the http PUT interface supplied to us by mako.
