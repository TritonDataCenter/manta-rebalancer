# Manta Rebalancer 
aThis repository is part of the Joyent Manta Project.  For contribution
guidelines, issues and general documentation, visit the
[Manta](https://github.com/joyent/manta) project pages.

## Overview
The Manta Object Rebalancer is comprised of two main parts: a manager and an
agent.  Currently, the main function of the rebalancer is to evacuate objects
from an operator specified storage server (i.e. mako).  A rebalancer agent runs
on every mako in manta, while the rebalancer manager delegates work to various
agents in the form of something called "assignments".  An assignment is a list
containing information about objects for a given agent to download.  Through a
series of agent selections and assignments an entire storage node can be fully
evacuated.

For information in each piece of the project, please see:
* [Rebalancer Manager Guide](docs/manager.md)
* [Rebalancer Agent Guide](docs/agent.md)

## Basic Rebalancer Topology
```
                       Manager receives a
                       request to evacuate
                       all objects from a
                       given storage node.

## Build

### Binaries
Build release versions of `rebalancer-manager`, `rebalancer-agent`, and
`rebalancer-adm`:
```
make all
```

Build debug versions of `rebalancer-manager`, `rebalancer-agent`, and
`rebalancer-adm`:
```
make debug
```

For specific instructions on building individual parts of the project, please
review the instructions in their respective pages (listed above).

### Images
Information on how to building Triton/Manta components to be deployed within
an image please see the [Developer Guide for Building Triton and Manta](https://github.com/joyent/triton/blob/master/docs/developer-guide/building.md#building-a-component).


### Pre-integration
Before integration of a change to any part of the rebalancer, the following
procedures must run cleanly:run `fmt`, `check`, `test`, and
[clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy):
```
cargo fmt -- --check
make check
make test
```

Note: On the `cargo fmt -- --check`, this will display any lines that *would*
be impacted by an actual run of `cargo fmt`.  It is recommended to first
evaluate the scope of the change that format *would* make.  If it's the case
that the tool catches long standing format errors, it might be desirable to
address those in a separate change, otherwise a reviewer may have trouble
determing what is related to a current change and what is cosmetic, historical
clean up.
